# Prometheus

Forethought planning system for the Tekton project ecosystem.

## Overview

Prometheus is the planning and preparation component of the Tekton ecosystem. It analyzes requirements, designs execution plans, and coordinates with other components to ensure successful outcomes.

## Components

### Prometheus (Forethought)

The primary planning system that:
- Analyzes requirements and constraints
- Designs multi-phase execution plans
- Coordinates with other Tekton components
- Prepares resources and dependencies
- Monitors execution progress

### Epimetheus (Afterthought)

The retrospective analysis system that:
- Evaluates completed operations
- Consults with Sophia, Metis, and Noesis on improvements
- Creates postmortem reports for developers
- Identifies patterns for optimization
- Recommends system-wide improvements

## Integration

Prometheus works closely with:
- **Telos**: To understand user requirements
- **Synthesis**: To execute the prepared plans
- **Sophia/Metis/Noesis**: To incorporate learning and optimization
